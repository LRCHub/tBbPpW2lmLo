Heaven says hello every morning
When the sun says,? Hi I've come to spend the day?
Heaven says hello with the songbirds
And the little flowers that nod along my way

And when the day is through and I hurry home to you
As the twilight steals across the golden skies
Heaven says hello when you kiss me
And I look into the blue of your eyes

Heaven says hello when you kiss me
And I look into the blue of your eyes
And I look into the blue of your eyes
